Hi Tonina,

I wanted to reach out to you because I recently came across a letter that appears to be addressed to someone with your name and surname.
I'm not sure if it belongs to you, but I thought it would be best to notify you just in case.

Please let me know if you are interested in retrieving the letter. I'm happy to help in any way I can.

Best regards,
Aleksei
